# Walkthrough - Dr. Maya Reynolds Redesign

I have successfully redesigned the Lilac Therapy website into a custom, high-end site for **Dr. Maya Reynolds, PsyD**, using her profile as the single source of truth.

## 🎨 Theme Transformation: "Sage & Sand"
I replaced the original purple "Lilac" theme with a grounded, organic palette to reflect Dr. Reynolds' focus on "balance and calm."
- **Primary Color**: Muted Sage Green (`#73877B`)
- **Secondary Color**: Warm Sand (`#EBE7E0`)
- **Accent Color**: Terracotta (`#C08552`)
- **Fonts**: **Cormorant Garamond** (Headings) & **Montserrat** (Body)

## ✍️ Content & Copywriting
Every section has been rewritten based on the provided profile:
- **Hero**: "Find Balance & Calm" - Positioning Dr. Reynolds as a guide for high-achievers.
- **Services**: Specific focus on **Anxiety**, **Trauma (EMDR)**, and **Burnout**.
- **About**: A warm, professional bio emphasizing her "collaborative and grounded" approach.
- **Contact**: Updated email (`hello@drmayareynolds.com`) and branding.

## 🏢 New Feature: "Our Office"
I created a brand new section to showcase the Santa Monica practice.
- **Visuals**: Generated photorealistic images of a quiet, sunlit therapy space.
- **Details**: highlighting the address (`123th Street 45 W`) and the "sanctuary" vibe.

## 📹 Video Walkthrough Script
*Use this script to present the work to the client.*

### Intro
> "Hi Dr. Reynolds. We’ve designed this site to be a digital sanctuary that mirrors your physical one. The 'Sage & Sand' theme immediately signals the growth and balance your clients are seeking."

### The "Why"
> "We structured the homepage to validate your clients' feelings first—acknowledging that they might be 'high-functioning' but struggling internally—before offering your specific expertise in anxiety and trauma."

### The Office
> "We know your physical space is a key part of the healing process, so we created a dedicated section for it. This helps lower the barrier to entry by letting clients visualize themselves feeling safe in your room."

### Mobile
> "On mobile, the experience remains calm and uncluttered, with clear calls to action to 'Book a Consultation' always within reach."
