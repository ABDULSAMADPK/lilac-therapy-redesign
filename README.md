## 🎨 Theme: Driftwood & Indigo
The site features a custom-designed aesthetic titled **"Driftwood & Indigo"**:
- **Indigo (#3B4B5A)**: Used as the primary color to signal stability, clinical authority, and depth.
- **Driftwood (#F7F3F0)**: A warm, oatmeal-toned background that brings in the natural, grounding light of the Santa Monica coast.
- **Muted Bronze (#A68A64)**: An accent color used for subtle highlights and call-to-actions.

### Typography
- **Fraunces**: A soft, elegant serif font for headings that balances clinical expertise with human empathy.
- **Outfit**: A modern, geometric sans-serif for body text, ensuring maximum readability for high-performing professionals.

## ✨ Key Features
- **SEO Optimized**: Headers and copy are specifically tailored for "Clinical Psychologist in Santa Monica" and keywords like "EMDR," "Trauma," and "High-Achiever Burnout."
- **Profile Integration**: All content is 100% derived from Dr. Maya Reynolds' professional Psychology Today profile, including her PsyD credentials and collaborative approach.
