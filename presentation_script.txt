---

## Video Demo Outline (2-4 Minutes)

### 1. Introduction (0:00 - 0:45)
Perspective: Warm, professional, and confident.
The Script:
"Hi Dr Reynolds! It's so great to meet you. I'm excited to walk you through the first draft of your new clinical home online. 

My main goal here was to take the wonderful depth of your clinical profile—your work with high-achievers, your focus on resilience, and your specified modalities like EMDR—and translate that into a visual experience that feels both professional and deeply calming. 

We’ve moved away from the generic 'lilac' feel of the template and created what I call the 'Driftwood & Indigo' theme. It’s designed to feel stable, sophisticated, and trustworthy—exactly the kind of environment your clients seek."

### 2. Desktop Walkthrough: The "Clinical Sanctuary" (0:45 - 2:00)
Action: Scroll through the homepage on desktop.
The Script:
"As we look at the desktop view, you'll see our first headline: 'Beyond Functional.' This speaks directly to those high-achieving adults you mentioned—people who are doing 'fine' on paper but are feeling the weight of burnout or trauma internally. 

I’ve used a deep slate blue (Indigo) as our primary color because it signals authority and stability, while the oatmeal (Driftwood) backgrounds keep the site from feeling 'cold' or overly medical. 

Notice the Areas of Focus section—we’ve highlighted EMDR and Burnout specifically because these are your core strengths. The typography is a blend of a very modern, clean font for information and a classic, elegant serif for your headings to give that 'established practice' feel."

### 3. Mobile View: Convenience & Accessibility (2:00 - 3:00)
Action: Switch to mobile view and scroll.
The Script:
"Now, many of your clients will likely find you while on the go, perhaps during a stressful workday. We’ve ensured the mobile experience is seamless. Everything stacks beautifully, the 'Book Consultation' button is always easy to find, and your portrait in the 'About' section creates that immediate human connection.

We’ve made sure your credentials—the PsyD—are front and center, establishing your expertise immediately. And look at the redesigned 'Our Office' section at the bottom—it showcases your physical space as a sanctuary, reinforcing the idea of safety and privacy you mentioned in your profile."

### 4. Conclusion & Benefits (3:00 - 4:00)
The Script:
"What this means for you, Dr. Reynolds, is a website that doesn't just look pretty—it works for you. By using specific keywords like 'Santa Monica Climate' and focusing on 'Evidence-Based Resilience,' we're setting you up to be found by the exact people you want to help. 

It’s professional, it’s private, and it’s uniquely 'you.' I'd love to hear your thoughts on this first version—whenever you're ready, let’s talk about any tweaks we can make to perfect it!"

## Design Justification (Non-Technical)

### Color Palette: Driftwood & Indigo
- Why: Indigo conveys the depth and stability of a clinical setting. Driftwood (Oatmeal) brings in the natural, grounding light of your Santa Monica location.
- Benefit: Clients feel they are in safe, professional, and calm hands from the second the page loads.

### Typography: Outfit & Fraunces
- Why: Outfit is clear and modern (easy for stressed eyes to read). Fraunces is a soft, elegant serif that feels "human" and slightly academic.
- Benefit: Projects the balance of high-level clinical expertise and warm, personal empathy.

### Content Strategy
- Why: Replaced generic therapy text with specific outcomes from your profile, like "Moving beyond functional."
- Benefit: Resonates instantly with your target demographic, making them feel "seen" before they even book a call.
